# Water Quality Test using Classification Algorithms

### 📌 Overview

Water quality is essential for both environmental sustainability and human health. This project leverages classification algorithms to evaluate and classify water samples into quality categories (e.g., Safe or Unsafe), offering a data-driven approach to water safety analysis.

---

### 🧠 Objective

To build a machine learning model that classifies water samples based on various chemical and physical properties using supervised classification algorithms.
